ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN…A PRESIDENTIAL GUESSING GAME!

Thank you for visiting my repository. This project is a twist on the hangman game that many played as kids.  Here’s a little information on how to play this game:
	The object of the game is to guess the last name of a former or current president before running out of the allotted points. 
	The game begins with 12 points.

To play:
	The game randomly selects the name of a president and places underscores the length of the name on the screen (presidents with the same last name will have the initials of his first name included).
	The user types a letter in the text box and presses the "Guess" button.
	If letter is included in the last name of the president, the game populates the letter in the correct underscore on the gameboard under "Current Word"; 
	If letter is not included in the last name of the president, the player loses a point.
	The gameboard displays all letters guessed at the bottom of the screen under "Letters Already Guessed."
	If the user selects a letter that has already been played, the system ignores it.  No points are lost. 
	If the user enters all letters in the name before running out of points, he/she wins.
	Upon winning, the gameboard will automatically clear and set up the next guess.
	Wins will not be cleared but will increment until the webpage is refreshed.
This project is targeted to elementary school students who are studying the U.S. presidential history or to anyone who wants to test their knowledge.
Hope you enjoy the game!
